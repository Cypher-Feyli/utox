utox - extracting UML from images into XMI files
================================================


About
-----
Liacs Software Engineering 2011, image-to-uml project.
This one is in C++. It is fast, above-par quality and has a high quality source
base.


Features
--------
Utox is not feature complete. Class diagrams are partially supported. No other
diagram types are supported yet.


Requirements
------------
To compile Utox, you will need OpenCV (>=2) and Tesseract (>=3). TinyXML is
distributed with Utox.
The source is standard C++/STL without platform-specific extensions.
Utox bundles a UML representation and XMI export library (libuml.a) that can be
statically compiled into other software.


Compilation
-----------
The entire project can be compiled by calling `make` from the top-level source
directory. Additionally, one can call `make DEBUG=yes` to build a version that
demonstrates its internal workings. Calling `make clean` reverts the repository
to a pristine state.


Usage
-----
The syntax is
$ utox [-v] -f input-file -o output-file
where -v makes utox more verbose.
The input-file can be any image file supported by both OpenCV and Leptonica and
must not use an alpha layer (transparency).
When in doubt, use ImageMagick to convert the input-file:
`convert input-file -background white -flatten input-file-good.png`.
The output-file will be overwritten (or created) by the XMI representation of
the UML diagram in the image, for as far as it is recognized by Utox.


Shortcomings
------------
Part of the achievement of Utox is it's organized code-base. Although not all
functions are commented with pre-conditions and post-conditions, the code has a
consistent indentation style and contains comments where they are relevant.
The directory structure is extendible and modular, as is the code.
What Utox does not do is make coffee. The shortcomings in the code are marked
"TODO" and consist mainly of features that are not yet implemented. Whenever
possible, markers are given on the work that needs to be done.
